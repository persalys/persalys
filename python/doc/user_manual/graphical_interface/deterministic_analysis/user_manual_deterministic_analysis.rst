User manual - Deterministic analyses

The interface allows the user to launch the following types of deterministic analysis:
  - Designs of experiments for model evaluations on a set of input values
  - Model evaluations
  - Screening
  - Optimization

1- Designs of experiments
=========================

The user may defined a set of input values and then evaluate output variable at these points.

1-1 Design of experiments creation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Create a new design of experiment through:
  - The **Design of experiments** item in the context menu of the relevant model in the study tree
    (item **Definition** and item **Probabilistic model** if it exists)

    .. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/physical_model/physicalModelDefinitionContextMenu.png
        :align: center

  - The **Design of experiments creation** box of the model diagram

    .. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/deterministicBoxes.png
        :align: center

  - The **New design of experiments** item in the context menu of the **Designs of experiments** item

    .. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/doe_contextMenu.png
        :align: center

.. _doeinputwizard:

In the resulting window, the user has to choose between three types of design prior to
click on the **Continue** button:

  - Full factorial design
  - Probabilistic design
  - Imported design

.. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/designOfExperiment.png
    :align: center

If the model does not contain stochastic input variables the **Probabilistic** item is disabled.

1-1-1 Deterministic design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/designOfExperimentDeterministic.png
    :align: center

This window enables to create a points grid by regularly discretizing a pavement with the number of
points specified in each direction.

The table lists all the input variables of the physical model.
The user can choose the ones which vary and the ones which are fixed.
A variable is fixed when the corresponding row is unselected (default: all variables
are unselected and the grid contains only one point).

- **Fixed input variables**:
  The user can define the value of the variable (default: value in
  the physical model definition). The values are expected to be floating points or integer.

- **Varying input variables**:
  The user has to define the lower and upper bound for the variable. The values
  of the variable will be regularly spaced between the bounds. The bounds are always points of the grid.

  The number of values is defined in the sixth column.
  The combo boxes of the fifth column have two items **Levels=** (default) and **Delta=**.

  - **Levels**: the user gives the number of points (default: 2).

  - **Delta**: the user gives the space between two points (default: (upper bound - lower bound)).


1-1-2 Probabilistic design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Define a probabilistic model to make this option available.

.. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/designOfExperimentProba.png
    :align: center

If stochastic input variables are present in the model, the **Probabilistic** item can be
selected in the **Input Sample definition** window. Then the next window allows one to specify:

  - the type of the design: LHS (Latin Hyper Cube), Monte Carlo, Quasi-Monte Carlo.
    If input variables are correlated, LHS design is not available
  - the size of the design of experiments
  - the seed of the random generator (default: 0, positive integer expected)

1-1-3 Import data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/designOfExperimentImport.png
    :align: center

The user can also import a design of experiments, from an external
file. It is then necessary to set the link between the columns of the
imported design and the input (and optionally output) variables of the
physical model, by clicking on the column name (default : first column
for the first input variable, second column for the second input
variable, etc...).

Use case:
"""""""""

The user wants to use an already evaluated design of experiments in a
csv file, knows the input variables distribution and wants to evaluate
the polynomial chaos coefficients. The method is as follows:
- create and empty model (for example symbolic)

- define the input and output variables

- create a probabilistic model and define the input distribution

- create an imported design of experiment

- the resulting metamodel will use probabilistic model distributions parameters

.. _doeinputwindow:

1-1-4 Design of experiments: input sample

When the input sample is defined, a new element appears in the study
tree, below **Designs of experiments**.

Its context menu has the following actions:
  - **Rename**: Rename the design of experiments

    (modify the inputs values leads to remove the output values from the design of experiments)

    (if the design of experiments contains already output values, this item is disabled)

3-3 Results
''''''''''''''

When the analysis is finished or stopped, a result window appears.

.. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/morrisResultWindow.png
    :align: center

On the left of the result window, the **Outputs** section allows the user to select the result to display.

The results window gathers several tabs:

- The **Elementary effects** tab presents for a selected output (left column):
  a table with the effects of each input variable and the mean of the absolute value (:math:`\mu*`),
  the standard deviation (:math:`\sigma`) and the mean (:math:`\mu`) of the elementary effects.
  These values are plotted in the graphs :math:`(\mu*, \sigma)` and :math:`(\mu*, \mu)`.

  .. image:: /user_manual/graphical_interface/deterministic_analysis/morrisGraph.png
      :align: center

  The types of effects are determined automatically according to two criteria
  modeled by two lines in the graph :math:`(\mu*, \sigma)`:

  - the green vertical dotted line, called *No effect boundary* is defined by:

    :math:`\mu_b* = \frac{max(\mu_i*) - min(\mu_i*)}{2}`, (with :math:`i` in :math:`[0, N]` and :math:`N` the number of inputs).

    It separates the variables into two groups:
      - the variables which have no effect (:math:`\mu_i < \mu_b*`)
      - the variables which have an effect (:math:`\mu_i < \mu_b*`)

    This boundary :math:`\mu_b*` can be changed by the user by moving the slider below the plot.

  - the blue dotted line, called 'cv = 0.5' is defined by: :math:`cv = \frac{\sigma_i}{\mu_i*} = 0.5`.

    It separates the variables into two groups:
        - the variables which have a linear effect (:math:`\frac{\sigma_i}{\mu_i*} <= 0.5`)
        - the variables which have a non-linear effect or interaction (:math:`\frac{\sigma_i}{\mu_i*} > 0.5`)

  - On the graph :math:`(\mu*, \mu)`, the blue lines separate the variables into two groups:
      - the monotonic variables (:math:`|\mu_i| \simeq \mu_i*`)
      - the non-monotonic variables (:math:`|\mu_i| < \mu_i*`)

    The sign of :math:`\mu_i` gives the direction of the effect.

  By default, in the table, the variables with no effect are unselected.

  The user can de/select variables manually by:
      - changing the state of the check button associated with the variable in the table
      - de/selecting points in the graphs (select points with a
        right-click drag and drop rectangle, then click on de/select
        button of the context menu which appears).
